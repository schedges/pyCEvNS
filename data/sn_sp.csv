#Gives neutron densities for spin up and down of 1.93 and 1.07. S_N = 1/2 * (1.93 - 1.07) = 0.43
#With isospin symmetry, approximate Sn ~ Sp

#Gives proton spin up density of 1.94, therefor spin down is  3-1.94 = 1.06, so S_p = 1/2(1.94 - 1.06) = 0.44
#Gives neutron spin up and spin down densities of 1.98 and 2.02, so S_n = 1/2 (1.98 - 2.02) = -0.02
